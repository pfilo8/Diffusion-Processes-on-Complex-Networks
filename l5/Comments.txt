Comments:
 - a very tasteful, thoughtful implementation, accompanied by pertinent comments
 - the only comment is that for Ex.3-B I requested only Infected curves being compared to each other for one graph topology for various levels of p (e.g. 3 infected curves for Barabasi Albert, for p=0.3, 0.5 and 0.8, all in plot, to easily observe the actual impact of the value of p)
