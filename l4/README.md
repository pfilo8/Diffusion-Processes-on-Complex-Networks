# Assignment 4 

## Task 1
The main aim of task number 1 was to simulate random walk on lattice using graph data structure.
It required implementation of 2d lattice graph generator which implementation can be found in `graph_generators/graph_generators.py` file.
Implementations of simulation and animation can be found in `Ex.1.ipynb` notebook.
Final result is an animation `outputs/animation.gif`.

## Task 2
The main aim of task number 2 was to simulate Pearson's random walk and make some reasoning about distribution of time spent in specific places on plane.
It required implementation of mentioned random walk which can be found in `main2.py` file. 
Results of simulation can be found in `Ex.2.ipynb` notebook.
There is also code responsible for generating animation which can be found in `outputs/task2_trajectory*.png`.

## Task 3
Task 3 was optional. The main aim of this task was to estimate average hit time from specific starting node to all other nodes.
Implementation of random walking on graph is in `main3.py` file.
Results for different graph topologies are included in `Ex.3.ipynb` notebook.

For this task I`ve used networkx library because I've made this task some time before list requirements and because
this task is not obligatory I've left implementation as it was :)
